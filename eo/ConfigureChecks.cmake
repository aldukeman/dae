# Use check_symbol_exists to check for symbols in a reliable
# cross-platform manner.  It accounts for different calling
# conventions and the possibility that the symbol is defined as a
# macro.  Note that some symbols require multiple includes in a
# specific order.  Refer to the man page for each symbol for which a
# check is to be added to get the proper set of headers. Example :

#check_symbol_exists(asymbol          "symbole.h"                 HAVE_SYMBOLE)
