Welcome to EO, the Evolving Objects library.

The latest news about EO can be found on the sourceforge repository at
    http://eodev.sourceforge.net/

In case of any problem, please e-mail us at
    eodev-help@lists.sourceforge.net, eodev@egroups.com

To get started, take a look at the tutorial, starting with
    ./tutorial/html/eoTutorial.html  

The easiest way to start programming a new genome with all EO
evolution engines handy is to create a new standalone EO project from
the tutorial/Templates/ directory. Read Lesson 5 of the tutorial for
an introduction;)


==================================================================
                      BUILDING EO
==================================================================
The basic installation procedure goes the following:

Go to your build-directory and run 
    $(SRCDIR)/configure
    make
    make check
    make install
where $(SRCDIR) is the top-level source directory of EO, i.e. where
the sources where unpacked.

Run "$(SRCDIR)/configure --help" for possible options. You can specify
to not build example applications, the tutorial, or to build the
ParadisEO tutorial. You may also change the installation directory
that way.

Now you should probably go to the tutorial and start learning about EO
features and programming.


In case of problems, you can read the INSTALL file - but remember this
is a standard installation file from GNU and that it contains nothing
specific about EO.


===================================================================
                       DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
===================================================================
After unpacking the archive file, you should end up with the following
structure:

.../                            the MAIN EO dir, created when unpacking
   |
   +-- src                    SOURCE dir. Contains most EO .h files
   |   |
   |   +- utils          general utilities (e.g. RNG-related source files)
   |   |
   |   +- ga             bistring-genotypes source files
   |   |
   |   +- es             real-valued-genotypes source files  
   |   |
   |   +- gp             Genetic Programming source files
   |   |
   |   +- obsolete       files from old versions - for upward compatibility
   |
   |
   |
   +-- tutorial               TUTORIAL dir (indeed :-)
   |   |
   |   +- html           all html files - start by browsing index.html
   |   | 
   |   +- LessonX        for X=1, 2, 3, ... : example of increasing complexity
   | 
   |
   |
   +-- doc                    DOCUMENTATION dir (generated by Doxygen)
   |   |
   |   +- html             HTML files - start at index.html (see also tutorial)
   |   |
   |   +- latex            latex files - use to generate Poatscript doc.
   |   |
   |   +- man              Unix man format documentation
   |
   |
   +-- test                   TEST files - for debugging purposes only
   |
   |
   +-- app                    APPLICATIONS - one dir per separate application
   |   |
   |   +- gprop            GA/backpropagation for neural nets 
   |   |
   |   +- mastermind       the wellknown MasterMind game
   |
   |
   +-- win                    WINDOWS dir: project files for MS/VC5+

              NOTES
===================================================================
If you extracted a fresh snapshot from the cvs-repository, remember
to run
    ./autogen.sh
in the source-directory before building the libraries.
